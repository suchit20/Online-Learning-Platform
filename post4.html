          <h3>Learn React Js in the Easiest way</h3>
          <p>
            React is a framework that employs Webpack to automatically compile
            React, JSX, and ES6 code while handling CSS file prefixes. React is
            a JavaScript-based UI development library. Although React is a
            library rather than a language, it is widely used in web
            development. The library first appeared in May 2013 and is now one
            of the most commonly used frontend libraries for web development.
            <br /><br />
            React offers various extensions for entire application architectural
            support, such as Flux and React Native, beyond mere UI. <br /><br />
            When compared to other technologies on the market, React is a new
            technology. Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, founded
            the library in 2011, giving it life. The likes of XHP, a
            straightforward HTML component framework for PHP, have an influence
            on React. React's newsfeed was its debut application in 2011. Later,
            Instagram picks it up and incorporates it into their platform.
            <br /><br />
            React's popularity today has eclipsed that of all other front-end
            development frameworks. Here is why: <br />
            <br />
            (i) Easy creation of dynamic applications: React makes it easier to
            create dynamic web applications because it requires less coding and
            offers more functionality, as opposed to JavaScript, where coding
            often gets complex very quickly. <br /><br />
            (ii) Improved performance: React uses Virtual DOM, thereby creating
            web applications faster. Virtual DOM compares the components
            previous states and updates only the items in the Real DOM that were
            changed, instead of updating all of the components again, as
            conventional web applications do. <br /><br />
            (iii) Reusable components: Components are the building blocks of any
            React application, and a single app usually consists of multiple
            components. These components have their logic and controls, and they
            can be reused throughout the application, which in turn dramatically
            reduces the application's development time. <br /><br />
            (iv) Unidirectional data flow: React follows a unidirectional data
            flow. This means that when designing a React app, developers often
            nest child components within parent components. Since the data flows
            in a single direction, it becomes easier to debug errors and know
            where a problem occurs in an application at the moment in question.
            <br /><br />
            (v) Small learning curve: React is easy to learn, as it mostly
            combines basic HTML and JavaScript concepts with some beneficial
            additions. Still, as is the case with other tools and frameworks,
            you have to spend some time to get a proper understanding of React's
            library. <br />
            <br />
            (vi) It can be used for the development of both web and mobile apps:
            We already know that React is used for the development of web
            applications, but that's not all it can do. There is a framework
            called React Native, derived from React itself, that is hugely
            popular and is used for creating beautiful mobile applications. So,
            in reality, React can be used for making both web and mobile
            applications. <br /><br />
            (vii) Dedicated tools for easy debugging: Facebook has released a
            Chrome extension that can be used to debug React applications. This
            makes the process of debugging React web applications faster and
            easier. <br /><br />
            The above reasons more than justify the popularity of the React
            library and why it is being adopted by a large number of
            organizations and businesses. Now let's familiarize ourselves with
            React's features. <br /><br />
            After answering what is ReactJs, let us know what are keys.
            <br /><br />
            While dealing with components that are produced periodically in
            React, keys are essential. Your component will continue to be
            uniquely identifiable after the modification if the key value is
            set. They aid React in determining which elements have changed, been
            eliminated, or been added. <br /><br />
            When making lists of components in React, you must use a special
            string personality factor "key". React uses keys to indicate which
            list items have been modified, destroyed, or altered. Or, to put it
            another way, we may say that keys are utilized to identify the
            components in lists. <br /><br />
            ReactJS Advantages :- <br />
            1- React.js builds a customized virtual DOM. Because the JavaScript
            virtual DOM is quicker than the conventional DOM, this will enhance
            the performance of apps. <br />
            2- ReactJS makes an amazing UI possible. <br />
            3- Search - engine friendly ReactJS. <br />
            4- React makes the entire scripting environment process simpler.
            <br />
            5- ReactJS is supported by a large community <br />
            <br />
            Limitations :- <br />
            1- Only addresses the app's angle and distance; as a result,
            additional techniques must be selected if you want a full collection
            of development tools. <br>
            2- Employs inline scripting and JSX, which some programmers might find uncomfortable.
